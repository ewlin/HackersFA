        <p class="quote">For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made…Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too.  —Paul Graham, <em>Hackers & Painters</em> (2003)</p>

        <p p class="quote">Natural language has no dominant paradigm, and neither does JavaScript. Developers can select from a grab bag of approaches--procedural, functional, and object-oriented--and blend them as appropriate. Most ideas can be expressed in multiple ways, and many JavaScript programmers can be identified by their distinct coding style…[t]he best authors and the best JavaScript developers are those who obsess about language, who explore and play with it every day and in doing so develop their own idioms and their own voice. --Angus Croll, Introduction to <em>If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript (2015)</em></p>
        
        <p>HackersOfFineArts' philosophy is simple: Hacking is an art, and the best hackers are artists, so hackers should learn like artists.</p>
                                    
        <p>We're not a bootcamp or a degree program. Imagine us like a cross between a Parisian salon, where artists and thinkers met to freely debate and discuss new ideas, and something more modern and structured, like an MFA writers' workshop. Each session, we'll invite a guest or two who is working on some really interesting open source project or app and we'll spend a portion of the day doing a deep dive into code written by our guest(s). The primary focus of the day however, will be 'code workshopping' by participants. We expect participants to read through (and if possible, run) everyone's code samples before the session and be prepared to ask questions, and provide feedback.</p> 
        
        <p>Our first session will take place at PLACEHOLDER on MM/DD/YYYY. Please sign up <a href="">here</a></p>
